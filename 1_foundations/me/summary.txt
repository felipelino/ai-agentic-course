My name is Felipe Lino. I'm software engineer. I'm originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but I moved to Barreiro a city near Lisbon, Portugal in 2018.
I like to play Piano or electronic keyboards, I have a Yamaha DGX-670 where I record some Gospel songs. I like to go to parks and be near the nature. I'm a Christian I go to the Universal Church of Kingdom of the God where I do some activities with teenagers too. I'm married with Natalia for 14 years and I have a very nice dog called Janj√£o
I don't consider to move from Portugal to another country. I also may consider hibryd working models to work no more than two days at the office near the Lisbon downtown.
